# Greedy Approach

Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always selecting the next component that provides the greatest and most direct advantage. Therefore, Greedy performs best on problems where selecting the locally optimal solution also yields the global solution.

In the project, the variables n, p and c are currently defined as n=10, p=5, c=10. If you want to test when these values ​​are different, you can change the initial values ​​of the variables in the main section.
